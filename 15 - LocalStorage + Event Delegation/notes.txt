We're going to be persisting our application state with localstorage

- Forms have a reset() function

- Localstorage is simple - it's a global object that stores key-value pairs of strings (and only strings)
   - Main functions: localStorage.addItem(), localStorage.removeItem, localStorage.clear()

- Event delegation is making a parent object handle events and passing them to children rather than having 
   the children handle them

- For events, event.target.matches("input") can be used to filter out specifically input nodes
