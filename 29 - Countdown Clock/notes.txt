- Sometimes setInterval doesn't run while the window isn't focused, or it pauses while scrolling
   - Our solution is to store the starting and ending time upfront, so whenever the interval works it's just
   updating the current time relative to the ending time that was already initially set

- If you have a form with a name attribute, that form can be accessed directly from the document object
   - E.g. document.customForm.addEventListener(...)
