We're making a colorful drawing pad with HTML5 canvas

- You don't draw on the canvas directly - you draw on the context (which can be 2D or 3D)

- HSL stands for Hue, Saturation, Lightness. 
   - Hue spans the full color spectrum as an integer from 0 to 360
   - Saturation is self explanatory as a %
   - Lightness is also self explanatory as a % from 0 (black) to 100 (white)
