We're making an analog clock in CSS, which has a realistic animation for the hands moving.

- We'll be using the CSS Transform property to rotate the hands.

- The issue with CSS rotation is that the origin is the center of the element it's rotating (it 
spins in place), which we don't want
   - Thus we'll be using transform-origin to change the origin (transform-origin: 100%)

- Since it starts out pointing towards 9:00, we use a 90deg rotation to set the correct default
orientation

- We use the transition-timing-function property to create the realistic ticking animation
